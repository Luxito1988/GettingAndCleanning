# Getting and Cleaning Data course project

## The R script run_analysis.R does the following:

  * Download and unzip source data if it doesn't exist.
  * Read data.
  * Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  * Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  * Write the data set to the set_tidy.txt file.
